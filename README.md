# Motorycle_marketplace_analysis_REDIS_MongoDB

In this assignment I had to work as data analyst in the motorcycle market field, creating a sequence of queries, using REDIS and MongoDB, that lead us to strategic decisions. We had access to a large dataset of 30k classified ads from the used motorcycles market, and other data that contain some seller related actions that have been tracked for a particular period.
